# Documentation – SQL Server → Power BI Modernization

## Project Context
Legacy SQL Server reporting relied on manual extracts and slow refresh cycles. Business users lacked scalability and self-service capabilities.

## Architecture
- **Ingestion:** Azure Data Factory pipelines automating extracts from SQL Server
- **Transformation:** Azure Databricks for scalable ETL and business rules
- **Analytics:** Synapse datasets optimized for reporting
- **Visualization:** Power BI dashboards enabling drill-down and self-service
- **Security:** Azure AD role-based access, Key Vault for credentials

## Business Outcomes
- Reporting latency reduced from hours to minutes
- Self-service analytics enabled across departments
- Improved scalability and reduced manual effort

## Lessons Learned
- Automating pipelines eliminated human error
- Cloud-native services improved agility and scalability
