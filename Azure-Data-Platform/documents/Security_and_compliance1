# 🏛 Project 1: Azure Data Platform (Fleet & Financial Reporting)

## Governance

* **Data Ownership:** Finance & Fleet Operations departments
* **Data Classification:** Internal, sensitive financial & operational data
* **Data Zones:** Raw → Curated → Analytics (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
* **Data Lineage:** Tracked using Azure Purview (or metadata registry)
* **Audit Logging:** All pipeline executions and transformations logged in Azure Monitor

## Security

* **Identity & Access Management:** Azure AD RBAC for developers, analysts, and admins
* **Secret Management:** Azure Key Vault for credentials and connection strings
* **Network Security:** Private endpoints for ADLS and Synapse; VPN or ExpressRoute for on-prem to cloud connectivity
* **Data Encryption:** At-rest (ADLS Storage Service Encryption) and in-transit (TLS 1.2)
* **Monitoring & Alerts:** Azure Monitor alerts for failures or unauthorized access attempts

## Compliance

* Aligns with **GDPR, POPIA, and internal financial data compliance** standards
* Regular quarterly reviews of access permissions and audit logs

# 🏛 Project 2: SQL Server → Power BI Modernization

## Governance

* **Data Ownership:** Finance & Reporting teams
* **Data Classification:** Internal reporting data
* **Data Zones:** Raw (staging) → Curated (cleaned & transformed) → Analytics (Power BI datasets)
* **Dataset Certification:** All Power BI datasets certified by data governance team
* **Data Lineage:** Documented for ETL transformations, joins, and aggregations

## Security

* **Identity & Access Management:** Azure AD with RLS for Power BI dashboards
* **Secret Management:** Key Vault for SQL Server and Synapse credentials
* **Network Security:** Private endpoints and firewall rules for Synapse SQL pools
* **Data Encryption:** Both in-transit and at-rest encryption enabled
* **Monitoring & Alerts:** Pipeline runs monitored via Azure Monitor; Power BI refresh failures tracked

## Compliance

* Self-service analytics follows **internal approval workflows** for dataset certification
* Quarterly audits of dataset usage, refresh logs, and access permissions

# 🏛 Project 3: Azure Incremental Data Pipeline (Streaming-Style)

## Governance

* **Data Ownership:** Mobility Operations & Business Analytics
* **Data Classification:** Operational and near real-time mobility data
* **Data Zones:** Raw → Curated → Analytics (near real-time dashboards)
* **Incremental Ingestion Logs:** Maintained to track watermark values and processed records
* **Data Lineage:** Documented for all incremental and deduplication steps

## Security

* **Identity & Access Management:** Azure AD RBAC for engineers and analysts
* **Secret Management:** All pipeline credentials and connection strings stored in Key Vault
* **Network Security:** Private endpoints, secure data transfer, VPN/ExpressRoute if required
* **Data Encryption:** At-rest and in-transit encryption enforced
* **Monitoring & Alerts:** Azure Monitor alerts for pipeline failures, incremental load errors, or anomalies

## Compliance

* Data access restricted based on operational roles
* Routine checks on incremental load completeness and data quality
* Compliance with internal mobility data policies and regulatory standards

# 📄 Shared Governance & Security Standards

* **Periodic Reviews:** Access, secrets, and compliance audits every quarter
* **Logging:** Centralized logs for all pipelines, transformations, and Power BI refreshes
* **Incident Response:** Standard operating procedure in place for data breaches or unauthorized access
* **Documentation:** All pipeline configurations, notebooks, and dashboards documented in GitHub
* **Data Retention:** Aligned with internal and regulatory requirements for retention and deletion
