🌐 Azure Data Engineering Migration Portfolio
Welcome to my professional portfolio showcasing three flagship Azure data engineering projects. Each project highlights a real-world problem, the solution implemented using Azure services, and the measurable business impact. Visual artifacts and case studies are linked for deeper exploration.

🚀 Project 1: Azure Data Platform
Overview: End-to-end Azure solution for fleet and financial reporting.

Problem: Fragmented on-prem SQL Server systems slowed reporting.

Solution: Automated ingestion, transformation, and analytics-ready datasets in Azure; Power BI dashboards for executives.

Impact: Reporting turnaround reduced from days to under 2 hours; fleet utilization improved 12%.

📊 Project 2: SQL Server → Power BI Modernization
Overview: Modernization of legacy SQL Server reporting with cloud-native Azure services.

Problem: Manual extracts, slow refresh cycles, limited scalability.

Solution: Automated ADF pipelines, transformation in Databricks, Synapse datasets, Power BI dashboards.

Impact: Reporting latency reduced from hours to minutes; self-service analytics enabled.

⚡ Project 3: Azure Incremental Data Pipeline (Streaming-Style)
Overview: Watermark-based incremental ingestion for high-volume mobility data.

Problem: Full dataset reloads delayed analytics and increased compute costs.

Solution: Incremental ingestion with ADF, deduplication in Databricks, Synapse for analytics, Power BI dashboards.

Impact: Pipeline execution 70% faster; infrastructure costs reduced; near real-time insights enabled.
