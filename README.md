🌐 Azure Data Engineering Migration Portfolio
👋 Overview

This portfolio showcases three flagship Azure Data Engineering projects demonstrating how cloud-native architectures enable scalable data ingestion, transformation, governance, and executive analytics.

Each case study reflects real-world enterprise scenarios, focusing on:

Cloud migration & modernization

Automated, scalable data pipelines

Analytics-ready datasets

Business-driven KPIs and measurable impact

🏗️ Architecture Patterns Demonstrated

On-prem SQL Server → Azure Cloud Migration

Batch & Incremental Data Processing

Lakehouse Architecture (Bronze / Silver / Gold)

Power BI Semantic Modeling & Executive Dashboards

Secure, governed Azure data platforms

🚀 Project 1: Azure Data Platform for Fleet & Financial Reporting
📌 Overview

End-to-end Azure data platform built to consolidate fleet and financial data into a single analytics layer for executive reporting.

❗ Business Problem

Fragmented on-prem SQL Server databases

Manual reporting processes

Slow turnaround for operational and financial insights

✅ Solution Architecture

Ingestion: Azure Data Factory from on-prem SQL Server

Storage: Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Raw / Curated / Analytics layers)

Transformation: Azure Databricks (Python & SQL)

Analytics: Azure Synapse + Power BI semantic model

📊 Business Impact

Fleet utilization increased to 85.6%

Downtime reduced to 320 hours

Reporting turnaround reduced from 45 hours to under 10 hours

Financial KPIs standardized and reported in ZAR

⚡ Project 3: Azure Incremental Data Pipeline (Streaming-Style)
📌 Overview

Incremental ingestion pipeline designed for high-volume mobility data using watermark-based processing.

❗ Business Problem

Full dataset reloads increased cost and latency

Delayed insights for operational teams

✅ Solution Architecture

Ingestion: ADF with watermark logic

Processing: Databricks (deduplication & incremental merges)

Analytics: Azure Synapse

Visualization: Power BI near real-time dashboards

📊 Business Impact

Pipeline execution time reduced by 70%

Monthly compute costs significantly reduced (ZAR)

Near real-time operational visibility achieved
