🌐 Azure Data Engineering Migration Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio showcasing three flagship Azure data engineering projects. Each case study demonstrates how cloud-native solutions drive business impact through scalable architecture, automation, and insightful analytics.

🚀 Project 1: Azure Data Platform

Overview: End-to-end Azure solution for fleet and financial reporting.

Problem: Fragmented on-prem SQL Server systems slowed reporting.

Solution: Automated ingestion, transformation, and analytics-ready datasets in Azure; Power BI dashboards for executives.

Impact: Reporting turnaround reduced from days to under 2 hours; fleet utilization improved 12%.

🔗 View Case Study🖼️ 📊 Fleet utilization improved to 85.6%, downtime reduced to 320 hours, and reporting turnaround dropped from 45 to <10 hours. Financial insights in ZAR enabled faster decisions across operations and finance.

📊 Project 2: SQL Server → Power BI Modernization

Overview: Modernization of legacy SQL Server reporting with cloud-native Azure services.

Problem: Manual extracts, slow refresh cycles, limited scalability.

Solution: Automated ADF pipelines, transformation in Databricks, Synapse datasets, Power BI dashboards.

Impact: Reporting latency reduced from hours to minutes; self-service analytics enabled.

🔗 View Case Study🖼️ 📊 Latency reduced to 12 hours, active users scaled to 550, and financial performance visualized in ZAR. Self-service analytics unlocked with department-level drilldowns and dynamic filters.

⚡ Project 3: Azure Incremental Data Pipeline (Streaming-Style)

Overview: Watermark-based incremental ingestion for high-volume mobility data.

Problem: Full dataset reloads delayed analytics and increased compute costs.

Solution: Incremental ingestion with ADF, deduplication in Databricks, Synapse for analytics, Power BI dashboards.

Impact: Pipeline execution 70% faster; infrastructure costs reduced; near real-time insights enabled.

🔗 View Case Study🖼️ 📊 Pipeline execution time dropped 70%, monthly compute costs reduced in ZAR, and real-time mobility data visualized for operational agility.
